<Summary>
- My first design course where I designed an innovative citizen-driven platform with a team, following the double diamond model.
- Brainstormed, researched, and defined three comprehensive concepts.
- Chose a strong concept and validated it through user interviews and a social media survey.
- Prototyping: Extracted main features, created prototypes in Figma and performed user testing.
</Summary>

This project was created for the course "Design Research for Digital Innovation" at the EPFL+ECAL Lab.

## Introduction

In the project "Voice", we believe that citizens should be more involved in their city's long-term
policy and urban planning. Our goal is to create a healthy environment where community discussions
and local proposals flourish.

With our app, you can easily crowdsource support for your proposal, collect data to strengthen your proposals and present it to official bodies near you.

## Design process

- Discover & Explore

With my team we **brainstormed** possible ideas and performed a **state of the art research** in different areas.

- Observe & Analyse

We **interviewed** 5 people from different backgrounds and countries,  plus we also collected **quantitative data** from our Instagram **survey**.

To analyse our results we applied the method of the **research wall** where we linked elements and insights from interviews and surveys to bring out knowledge.

The deliverable of this phase is the **challenge map**, where we define for **who** we are designing, **what** we will design and **why**.
Finally, we defined what **design research hypothesis** we want to answer.

- Ideation

We designed a **moodboard** for our app and then we described a **persona** and 3 **scenarios**.
Finally, we developed a **flow chart** that will be the base for our prototype in Figma.

## Prototype

Our app evolves around the main feature of **"proposal"**. Users can add or follow proposals that can affect urban planning or city policies.
For each proposal there are three pages: **Description**, **Survey** and **References**.
<div style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms', display: 'flex', width: '60%' }} className="text-dark-minsk w-3/5">
  <div className="w-1/3">
    <img src="/voice-description.png" alt="Ciao" className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-survey.png" alt="Ciao" className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-ref.png" alt="Ciao" className="mb-4 w-1/3" />
  </div>
</div>

To help users in the creation of effective proposals we defined 3 temporal phases in the development of an effective motion: 

1. Editable proposal
2. Open Survey 
3. Published

<div style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms', display: 'flex', width: '60%', paddingTop:'10px'}} className="text-dark-minsk w-3/5">
  <div className="w-1/3">
    <img src="/voice-home-page.png" alt="Ciao" className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-trends.png" alt="Ciao" className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-new-proposal.png" alt="Ciao" className="mb-4" />
  </div>
</div>

## User Testing

For our user testing, we followed the method of **task scenarios**.

Results indicated that for our users, “Voice” is visually appealing, exciting, attractive,
and inventive, and they give a 5.84/7 average score toward these features above. They also find
the prototype efficient and supportive (5.85/7). At the same time, about
half of our subjects found the prototype quite complicated (4.14/7) and confusing (4.42/7).

Furthermore, users recognize our work for realizing the initial
goals. All of them give positive comments on “Voice” can better encourage people to propose
and support the hot issues to improve society. Most of them (5/7 users) believe “Voice” can
shorten the distance between citizens and authorities, and make individual voices better heard.

## Future Improvements

1. What factors lead to successful proposals that have an actual impact?
2. How could we improve the follow-up experience for published proposals/surveys?

## My experience
This course was fundamental for learning the basis of design research. 
I applied some UX research methods like interviews and surveys, plus I learned prototyping in Figma and I tested it by doing user testing.

What interested me particularly was the step between the data analysis (qualitative and quantitative) and the insights that will be the base of the prototype.
How to better analyse, group and consolidate insights from the data?

In the future I would be happy to apply different research methods, both qualitative and quantitative, and test my results with A/B testing or the Think Aloud Protocol.
