This project was created for the course "Design Research for Digital Innovation" at the EPFL+ECAL Lab.

## Introduction

In the project "Voice", we believe that citizens should be more involved in their city's long-term
policy and urban planning. This inner desire to change should be channeled and stimulated by
tools that truly provoke societal movements. Our goal is to create a healthy environment where community discussions
and local proposals flourish.
Our way to give a voice to the citizens is by helping them to structure their ideas and gathering
other people around them, giving them strength.
With our app, you can easily crowdsource support for your proposal and gather feedback from
others in your community.
We also provide tools for collecting data to strengthen your proposals, such as surveys and
other feedback forms.
Once your proposal is ready, our platform will make it easy for you to present it to official bodies,
giving you the power to impact your city's long-term policy and urban planning.

## Design process

For our research phase, we got from the professor a project goal based on designing a citizen-driven platform similar to the one used in Zurich for [collecting reports about city issues](https://www.zueriwieneu.ch/reports).
Starting from this incipit we had to find 3 defined concepts and then select one out of them.

- Discover & Explore

To do that, we had to **brainstorm** possible ideas and areas to discover and then with my group we divided the **state of the art research** in different areas.
We had three possible directions: the city as a map of stories, delve into digital civic participation, or gathering apps for social meetings and events.
After our presentation to the professor and TAs we gathered the feedback and we opted for the civic participation.

- Observe & Analyse

In the second phase we had to recollect what we found in our state of the art research and define our next research methods to apply. 
We decided to **interview** 5 people from different backgrounds and countries,  plus we also collected **quantitative data** from our Instagram **survey**.

To analyse our results we applied the method of the **research wall** where we linked elements and insights from interviews and surveys to bring out knowledge.

The deliverable of this phase is the **challenge map**, where we define for **who** we are designing, **what** we will design and **why**.
Finally, we defined what **design research hypothesis** we want to answer: 



<div className="w-3/5 items-center text-center">

<b className="text-dark-minsk" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }} >Citizen Interest & Collecting Influence</b>

<p className="text-dark-minsk p-3" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }}>1 - Does organized and clear structure in proposal-making increase citizen interest?</p>
<p className="text-dark-minsk p-3" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }}>2 - Will publishing the results of surveys increase the interest of public opinion on such issues?</p>
<p className="text-dark-minsk p-3" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }}>3 - Could grouping and collecting their influence from minorities and individual citizens be easier with this app?</p>
<p className="text-dark-minsk p-3" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }}>4 - Could people start to believe that they have more impact over their concerns with this app?</p>


<b className="text-dark-minsk" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }} >Local authorities accountability</b>

<p className="text-dark-minsk p-3" style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms' }}>1 - Could this app make the local authorities more accountable for their decisions?</p>

</div>

This last point is the one on which we explored less in our project, it could be a point of evolution
in the hypothetical future steps of this project.

- Ideation

After having defined our main concept, we designed a **moodboard** for our app and then we described a **persona** and 3 **scenarios**.
Finally, we developed a **flow chart** that will be the base for our prototype in Figma. 
This helped us to define the main features that will add to our app.

## Prototype

Our app evolves around the main feature of **"proposal"**. Users can add or follow proposals that can affect urban planning or city policies.
For each proposal there are three pages: **Description**, **Survey** and **References**.
The Description pages should describe the proposal in detail, while the other two are the features that help the creators to effectively create a better proposal.
The Survey feature will help them collect real data on people's opinion, while the References will help to further support the project with sources like papers or articles.

<div style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms', display: 'flex' }} className="text-dark-minsk w-3/5">
  <div className="w-1/3">
    <img src="/voice-description.png" alt="Ciao" style={{ width: '308px' }} className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-survey.png" alt="Ciao" style={{ width: '300px' }} className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-ref.png" alt="Ciao" style={{ width: '305px' }} className="mb-4" />
  </div>
</div>

To help users in the creation of effective proposals we defined 3 temporal phases in the development of an effective motion:

1. Editable proposal

In this first phase the creators of the proposal can edit the 3 pages, by editing the description, adding questions to the Survey page or add References and sources.
People can comment and recommend questions or references that will be checked by the creators.

2. Open Survey 

In the Open Survey phase, everyone can answer to the survey and add their opinion. The proposal can't be modified.

3. Published

At the last stage, the results from the survey are published and the proposal is ready to be sent to the local authorities.

<div style={{ fontFamily: 'tt-norms', display: 'flex' }} className="text-dark-minsk w-3/5">
  <div className="w-1/3">
    <img src="/voice-home-page.png" alt="Ciao" style={{ width: '300px' }} className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-trends.png" alt="Ciao" style={{ width: '300px' }} className="mb-4" />
  </div>
  <div className="w-1/3" style={{ marginLeft: '20px' }}>
    <img src="/voice-new-proposal.png" alt="Ciao" style={{ width: '300px' }} className="mb-4" />
  </div>
</div>

Our prototype is taking inspiration from social media platforms like Twitter, as we have designed an app that was minimalistic and neutral.
By using some design elements like Helvetica font or big titles we want to express energy and the potential impact that the app could have.



## User Testing

Before applying any user testing techniques we had an important class on different **UX evaluation methods**.

For our user testing, we followed the method of **task scenarios**, where we gave some tasks to complete to the user and analyzed their behavior both qualitatively and quantitatively with a survey following the test.
In our questionnaire, we focus on two parts to evaluate our project: the prototype and design of “Voice” and the extent to realize our initial goal after using the app.

In the first part, we ask users to score “Voice” based on the coherency between modules, the
degree of coordination between color and theme, the innovative, exciting, efficient extent, and
the use complexity of “Voice”.

In the second part, we ask users to give their comments on how realistically “Voice” applies to
the original goals by using it: if “Voice” increases citizens’ interest to be enrolled in community
governance, if it makes it easier to collect individual influence and give everybody a say for their
city, and if it makes local authorities more accountable and more transparent. The feedback from
these questions help us to evaluate the degree to which our work achieves the intended goals
and how our work might affect society.

Results for the first part indicated that for our users, “Voice” is visually appealing, exciting, attractive,
and inventive, and they give a 5.84/7 average score toward these features above. They also find
the prototype efficient and supportive, giving a 5.85/7 average score. At the same time, about
half of our subjects found the prototype quite complicated (4.14/7) and confusing (4.42/7).

For the second part our users recognize our work for realizing the initial
goals. All of them give positive comments on “Voice” can better encourage people to propose
and support the hot issues to improve society. Most of them (5/7 users) believe “Voice” can
shorten the distance between citizens and authorities, and make individual voices better heard.

## Future Improvements

1. What factors lead to successful proposals that have an actual impact?

We need more research on the hypothesis that surveys, references and our features help to
create a stronger proposal. We know from our user testing that people like these features but do
they actually increase its probability of success?

2. Reflection on potential biases in the users

We are designing for the people who are most politically active. Could there be a bias in app usage based on factors such as gender, race, and income that can lead to skewed
results and ultimately damage the app's credibility?

3. Improving the follow-up experience for published proposals/surveys

After a proposal is published, what can we do to make the users feel rewarded for their efforts?
We should think of possible options to get the attention of the authorities on the proposals that
got published and gather a lot of influence.

## My experience
This course was fundamental for learning the basis of design research. 
I applied some UX research methods like interviews and surveys, plus I learned prototyping in Figma and I tested it by doing user testing.

What interested me particularly was the step between the data analysis (qualitative and quantitative) and the insights that will be the base of the prototype.
How to better analyse, group and consolidate insights from the data? That's something that interested me the most from this course.

In the future I would be happy to apply different research methods, both qualitative and quantitative, and test my results with A/B testing or the Think Aloud Protocol.
