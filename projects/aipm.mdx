## What I Learned

#### PM Mindset

A Product Manager is a **"Conductor of an orchestra"**. This is what Amin Kaboli taught us during the course. He emphasized the importance of focusing on the value we want to create, the target customer, and the ability of our product to provide that value to that customer.

We also investigated which **qualities** a truly good manager have. To list some:
- effective communication (speaking, writing, listening)
- leadership
- result-oriented
- emotional intelligence
- growth mindset
- technical skills

By the end of the course, I had the opportunity to assess these qualities in me, where are my points of strength and where I can improve.

#### Product discovery and development process

During the course, we started from identifying **potential customer needs** and we reached the **product launch** of our MVP. But how did we get there?

There's a notable distinction between **product discovery** and **product development**. During the discovery phase, we investigate customer needs, identify potential business opportunities and pinpointing user pain points. 
This research is then summarized in Product Vision, Product Strategy and Roadmap.

In the development phase we use the **Scrum** methodology to develop quickly our product, from design to launch.

Once the product is released, we can get important **feedback** that can help the discovery of new potential products or modifications of the existing ones.

During this process I also recognized the importance of UX/UI Design skills, that I developed in other projects (

) and also technical competencies such as Software Engineering and ML.

#### Teamwork

This project was a journey with many ups and downs. I learned how be part of a team, discuss, having efficient meetings, divide the workload and conflict management.
